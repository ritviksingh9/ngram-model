This program is one of the most basic forms of a probabilistic language model.  It parses sample text(s) and by considering the probability of a token, determines the words/punctuation that would most likely follow it.  '308.txt' is Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K.  '45506.txt' is Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbot. '18155.txt' is The Story of the Three Little Pigs.  All of these texts were gathered from https://www.gutenberg.org.  These texts were modified so that they only contained the text in each chapter.  The utilities.py was provided by our instructors in ESC180 course.
